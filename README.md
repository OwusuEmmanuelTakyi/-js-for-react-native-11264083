# Project Overview

This project consists of several JavaScript tasks that demonstrate data manipulation through arrays and functions. Each file is designed to accomplish a specific task and works together with others to showcase JavaScript programming techniques.

- Your Student ID: 11264083

## Task 1: Array Manipulation
`arrayManipulation.js` contains a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an input. It processes this array by squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers. The output is a new array with these modified values.

## Task 2: String Formatting
`arrayManipulation.js` also includes `formatArrayStrings`, a function that modifies an array of strings based on an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It capitalizes strings corresponding to even numbers and converts strings to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: User Profiles Creation
`userInfo.js` features a function `createUserProfiles` which generates user profiles from two arrays: original names and their modified versions from Task 2. Each profile includes an ID, original name, and modified name.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can run each script separately by using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node <arrayManipulation.js or userInfo.js >
